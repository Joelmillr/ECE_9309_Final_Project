# Exploring the Dualistic Nature of the Reward Function for an Autonomous Agent in CARLA
This project explores the dualistic nature to consider when defining the reward function for a reinforcement learning (RL) agent used for autonomous vehicle (AV) operation. Through a series of experiments within the CARLA simulation environment, this work investigates the impact of various reward structures on a simple RL agent's behavior. The objective of this work was to offer valuable insights and practical guidance for future AV researchers, on optimizing reward functions despite their paradoxical nature. The results showcase both the beneficial and detrimental behaviors that emerge under different reward settings, thereby underscoring the intricacy of its design in RL, especially for AVs.

## Prerequisites
This project utilizes [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases) version 0.9.15. 

Town 10 was used as the simulated driving environment.
